# 2chevskii's .dotfiles (and more)

This repository contains various configuration files I use in my setup,
as follows:

> Note:
> Root of the repository corresponds to the `USERPROFILE` environment
> variable (**Windows**)
>
> Additional root folders are prefixed with `__` (double underscore)
> and use the same character as a replacement for directory separator char (`\` or `/`)
>
> Example: `__D__ProgramFiles__ghidra`

.gitconfig | Global Git configuration | Credentials omitted; File renamed (`.gitconfig` => `_gitconfig`) to avoid git from using it as a configuration for this repository
